    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I studied applied mathematics during my undergraduate years and graduated in May 2024. After graduation, 
      I explored different paths and began self-directed learning through online courses while researching job opportunities.</p>
    <p>I’m interested in data science and machine learning and am currently pursuing a career in these fields with curiosity and a growth mindset.</p>
    <p>I value humility, kindness, and perceptiveness—qualities I’ve learned from those closest to me. 
      I enjoy spending time with my loved one, connecting with nature, and finding balance through yoga, dance, and quiet, peaceful environments.</p>
    <p>(Resume is available upon request, based on the job type:))</p>
