    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In addition to a background in mathematics, I’ve devoted significant time to self-directed learning 
      outside of academia in pursuit of personal and professional growth. I’m currently seeking the right opportunity 
      in computational data science with a focus on machine learning. I’m especially interested in developing 
      data-driven solutions and intelligent systems that support evidence-based decision-making.</p>
    
    <p>I value humility and believe that meaningful growth comes through continuous learning. 
      Outside of work and study, I enjoy spending time with my family, connecting with nature, 
      and finding balance through yoga, dance, and quiet, peaceful environments.</p>

    <p>If you’re aware of a relevant opportunity, a role-specific resume is available upon request.</p>

    <p>Thanks again for visiting my portfolio!</p>
