    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I studied applied mathematics for my undergraduate degree and graduated in May 2024. 
      Afterward, I explored various career paths and engaged in self-directed learning through online courses while researching job opportunities.</p>
    
    <p>I’m currently pursuing a career in data science and machine learning and am actively seeking opportunities in these fields.</p>
    
    <p>I have a deep love for learning, it gives meaning to my life and motivates me every day. 
      I value humility and strongly believe that growth comes through continuous learning. 
      Coming from a unique background, I understand the importance of creating your own opportunities. 
      I wouldn’t be where I am today without a strong commitment to lifelong learning and perseverance through challenges. 
    Outside of work and study, I enjoy spending time with my loved one, 
      connecting with nature, and finding balance through yoga, dance, and quiet, peaceful environments.</p>

    <p>If you’re aware of a relevant opportunity, a role-specific resume is available upon request.</p>

    <p>Thanks again for visiting my portfolio!</p>
