    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I studied applied mathematics during my undergraduate years and graduated in May 2024. After graduation, 
      I explored different paths and began self-directed learning through online courses while researching job opportunities.</p>
    <p>My path to graduation and beyond hasn’t been easy, shaped by life events that have strengthened my resolve as a non-traditional student. 
      A few months after graduating, I discovered a passion for data science and machine learning, 
      and I’m now pursuing a career in these fields with curiosity and a growth mindset.</p>
    <p>I value humility, kindness, and perceptiveness—traits I’ve learned from my grandparents and my dear husband. Whenever possible, 
      I enjoy spending time with my loved one, connecting with nature, and finding balance through yoga, dance, and quiet, peaceful spaces. 
      I also occasionally play chess and draw to unwind.</p>
